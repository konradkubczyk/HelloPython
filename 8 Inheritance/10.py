# A variable created outside of the __init__ method is a class variable. Unlike an instance variable, a class variable holds a value that is common (and therefore identical) to all objects created from that class.

# Run the program below. Note how the class variable is declared and how it is modified. Specify a class variable in the program, the place where it is modified and the place where its value was used.

# class definition
class Film():
    # class variables
    cinema = "Multikino"
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.title} ({Film.cinema})"

# program
film1 = Film("The Shawshank Redemption")
print(film1)
film2 = Film("Pulp Fiction")
print(film2)

# renaming the cinema (changing the value # of a class variable)
Film.cinema = "Cinema City"
print(film1)
print(film2)
