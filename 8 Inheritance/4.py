# For the convenience and readability of the program code, it is possible to create a text representation of an object in the form of a string. Such an object can then be used wherever string data is required, e.g. when calling print().

# Run the program below. Note the __str__ method and the call of the print() function.

class University():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name + " is the best!"
