# A static method is the kind of method that is called in the context of a class, not objects that are created from that class. The following program defines a static method.

class Arrays():
    @staticmethod
    def print_in_col(array):
        for c in array:
            print(c)
    @staticmethod
    def print_in_row(array):
        print(", ".join(str(element) for element in array))

my_array = [4,1,8,7,2]
Arrays.print_in_col(my_array)
Arrays.print_in_row(my_array)

# Then complete the class with another static method that displays the contents of an array in a row, separating the values with a comma. Make sure that the comma is not displayed after the last value. Call a new method in the program.
